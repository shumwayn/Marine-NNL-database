Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
Environmental Offsets Policy",Suitable offsets must deliver an overall conservation outcome that improves or maintains the viability of the protected aspect of the environment ,"Minimum of 90% direct offsets, maximum of 10% other compensatory measures. Both components should correlate to the specific nature of the impact and its timeframe. Direct offsets ? must deliver a tangible & measurable on-ground conservation gain.Offsets are defined as measures that compensate for the residual adverse impacts of an action on the environment. Where appropriate, offsets are considered during the assessment phase of an environmental impact assessment under the EPBC Act. This policy relates to all matters protected under the EPBC Act (?protected matters?). These are:
? world heritage properties
? national heritage places
? wetlands of international importance (listed under the Ramsar Convention)
? listed threatened species and ecological communities
? migratory species protected under international agreements
? Commonwealth marine areas
? the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
? the environment, where nuclear actions are involved;
? the environment, where actions proposed are on, or will affect Commonwealth land and the environment,the environment, where Commonwealth agencies are proposing to take an action.                     The term ?environmental offsets? refers to measures that compensate for the residual adverse impacts of an action on the environment. Offsets provide environmental benefits to counterbalance the impacts
that remain after avoidance and mitigation measures. These remaining, unavoidable impacts are termed ?residual impacts?.
For assessments under the EPBC Act, offsets are only required if residual impacts are significant. (Australian Government)
","Offsets should compensate for an impact for the full duration of the impact. Offsets that deliver an outcome prior to the impact commencing are encouraged, as they minimise effects on the protected matter resulting from offset time delays",Established,,Not stated,Madsen et al. 2010; Commonwealth of Australia. 2012. Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 Environmental Offsets Policy;  Ten Kate and Crowe 2014;,"Tier 2 indicates that some elements and encouraging initiatives are in place although regulatory additions are needed. Risks are present and should be mitigated prior to the implementation of a
banking scheme; otherwise these could have a critical impact on scheme development.

Argentina has a short history of environmental compensation laws through their Civil Code
(Article 1083) and EIA, but there is very little enforcement and regulation. Their EIA law (no.
25,675, written in 2002), the Environmental Framework Law (Ley General del Ambiente,
LGA), defines the standards and implementation practices for development projects that will
impact biodiversity, although it does not clearly call for offsets for those impacts.19
Developers must only submit an Environmental Impact Study, which is then rejected or approved. If
the project is approved, and it has been shown that restoration for environmental impacts
is not possible, the project must pay into the Environmental Compensation Fund (Fondo
de Compensaci¢n Ambiental) which is used to compensate for and prevent future losses to
biodiversity (i.e. establishing protected areas). The practical operation of this fund, however, is
unknown. An adaptation to the mitigation hierarchy is followed under the LGA (minimize, prevent
and mitigate, then restore), but real application is absent. One example cites a compensation
ratio of 5:1 (five trees planted for every one cut down), but there is not a consistent ratio across
the board, and compensation in practice is difficult to find.20 (Madsen et al. 2010).

EIA laws requiring mitigation/compensation measures (though not necessarily true offsets) are in place in Argentina, Belize, Uruguay, and Panama. Argentina and Costa Rica also maintain national-level compensation funds to channel compensation fees; similar funds exist in Peru at the provincial level (Ecosystem marketplace).

 In the past few years, there has been a wide proliferation of innovative biodiversity finance mechanisms, such as payments for ecosystem services, conservation trust funds, biodiversity offsets and bio-carbon funding, among many others. Argentina is still in the early stages of exploring these mechanisms. Through this proposal, specific efforts will be made to explore those mechanisms that can be successfully adopted in the country for medium and long term funding (thegef)",

As seen before, a proportion of the money used for MPA implementation in Brazil derives from the ?environmental compensation? legal compromise of development enterprises (e.g. oil and the ports sector), whereby they provide funds for MPAs to offset the environmental impacts of their activities. Some sites have been almost fully dependent on these financial sources for several years, as is the case of Abrolhos MNP. As well as the ethical and equity issues raised by such compensation, the administrative processes through which these funds pass were also considered to be very bureaucratic, consequently limiting their translation into effective marine conservation outcomes. Gerhardinger et al. 2010.","required that a maximum of 0.5% of the capital costs of the development go to the Protected Areas System (Sistema Nacional de

Environmental Compensation Fund is to be used solely for protection of existing protected areas (categories I and II according to the
IUCN), unless a protected area itself is directly affected by the development work. (Madsen et al.)

In Brazil projects subject to environmental licensing must offset their impacts on environmental assets. Impacts on Protected Areas (Law 9985 of 2000), caves (Decree 6640 of 2006) and coastal native vegetation (Decree 5300 of 2004) shall always be offset, although the environmental authority (IBAMA) may require the developer to offset any other residual impacts identified. In Brazil all projects subject to EIA can utilize offsets and those EIAs shown to cause negative impacts on protected areas must implement offsets according to the scheme set by Law 9985. The effective implementation of the offsets can be carried out either by the developer (Normative Instruction 20 of 2011, article 11) or by the agency responsible for managing the protected area (ICMBio
[Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation] in the case of Federal Protected Areas). Offsets will always be aimed at supporting conservation units of the National System of Protected Areas (SNUC, by its Brazilian acronym; Law 9985). During the time this system has been operational, it has generated over US$200 million to be invested in protected areas (Gustavo Pinheiro, personal communication). (Villarroya et al. 2014).

No definition exists with respect to significant impacts. Therefore the environmental impact study has

Cameroon,Organisation,Africa,Yes,No,No,Neither,Offset,,Lom Pangar Hydropower Project (LPHP),Voluntary,,,"The Lom Pangar Hydropower Project (LPHP) consists of a regulating, 50-m high dam located on the River Lom in Cameroon?s East Region, a 610-km2 reservoir area, a hydroelectric power plant, a transmission line, and a rural electrification scheme along this transmission line. Estimated costs for the LPHP are USD 393 million from the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Central African States Development Bank (BDEAC), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the French Agency for Development (AFD), the Government of Cameroon, and the World Bank. The Environmental and Social Assessment noted that the main impact would be the flooding of natural forest, that none of the flooded habitat was critical, but that the dam site was located next to portions of the Deng Deng forest that included critical habitats and populations of the Critically Endangered (CR) Western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and the Endangered (EN) Central chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes). About 990 gorillas are located in the greater Deng Deng area, with over 50% of this population resident in Deng Deng National Park itself; the others are located in the Forest Management Unit UFA 10?65 and in the Belabo Forest [54]. Suggested mitigation included an adjustment to the pipeline route to avoid the central Deng Deng and other dense forest areas and control of access to the area to prevent illegal logging during the construction phase. Nonetheless, the project was predicted to have significant impacts on natural habitats that should be compensated. Studies funded by the AFD and carried out by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), estimated a population size of several hundred gorillas in the greater Deng Deng area, which included a communal forest and a logging concession. As a result, a decision was made that the company would provide a high-level compensation package designed to strengthen protection of the newly designated 580-km2 Deng Deng National Park, extend its boundary, and establish a corridor to other forest areas [55]. A third-party analysis indicated that an annual payment of USD 700,000 per year would be required to provide sufficient financing to meet the conservation management needs in the region. The activities in Lom Pangar are considered compensation rather than an offset since no efforts were made to quantify losses or gains to biodiversity and offset them to achieve no net loss.

Chad-Cameroon Pipeline: A 1,070 km (660 miles) pipeline from oil wells in landlocked Chad to the ports of Cameroon inspired a heated environmental controversy that has led to some interesting lessons in terms of offsets.
In order to mitigate the possible environmental damages of the US$3.5 billion dollar project, particularly in Cameroon (where most of the pipeline was constructed), the project partners (ExxonMobil, Petronas, and Chevron), together with the World Bank, created an environmental foundation (known as the Foundation for Environment and Development in Cameroon, or
FEDEC), two new national parks, and an ?Indigenous Peoples Plan? to ?provide long-term
benefits to the Pygmy population that is affected by the project .? These three initiatives will be
funded through a US$3.5 million contribution from the Cameroon Oil Transport Corporation
(COTCO), the joint venture created by the three companies and the government of Cameroon
to construct and manage the operations of the pipeline and oil-loading facilities in that country.
Of this money, US$600,000 will go to the Indigenous Peoples Plan and related activities,
US$1.4 million for the creation and management of a national park in the Campo Reserve near
Cameroon?s Atlantic Littoral forest area, and US$1.5 million for the creation and management
of a new national park in the Mbam Djerem area to the west of the Deng Deng forest","Two of the projects we examined based additionality on ?averted loss? by updating the protected status of an area; the Loma Mountains National Park in Sierra Leone for BHP, and the Deng Deng National Park in Cameroon for the Lom Pangar Dam, and in the case of Lom Pangar extending areas for conservation around the park to protect great ape habitat (Kormos et al. 2014).",,Preliminary,confirmed,,"TenKate and Crowe 2014 https://www.cbd.int/financial/offsets/g-offsets-iucn.pdf

A 2005 study of 124 authorisations showed that only 10% of pre-impact assessments and 12% of post-construction monitoring moved beyond area-based metrics to estimate of productive capacity (Harper and Quigley, 2005).

In 2012, the Canadian government altered the Act by removing reference to HADD, replacing this text with: ?No person shall carry on any work, undertaking or activity that results in serious harm to fish that are part of a commercial, recreational or Aboriginal fishery, or to fish that support such a fishery?.

Chile?s EIA law explicitly requires avoidance,

In Chile the government recently modified important aspects of environmental impact assessment policy to allow offsetting and is in the process of revising the offset framework within a new biodiversity and protected area policy. Because there are on-going marine and coastal impacts from the private and public sector throughout Chile (Jara 2005), we anticipate opportunities for marine biodiversity offset programs under a voluntary and regulatory scenario (Bovarnick et al. 2010). For instance, outfall pipes from pulp mills are common on the coast, and the Chilean pulp industry is pursuing environmental certifi-
cation standards (S.G., unpublished data). Similarly, thermoelectric plants are being developed along the Chilean coast to meet growing electricity demand (Carcamo et al. 2011). Our recent interviews with executives suggest that companies are interested in no net biodiversity loss programs and are willing to consider participating in biodiversity offset programs (S.G., unpublished data). Fisher-managed no-take zones within TURFS, located in  the region where pulp mill or thermoelectric marine impacts are occurring, could provide a source of like-for-like biodiversity offsets, whether those impacts are temporary
or permanent. (Gelcich et al. 2015)

Because there are on-going marine and coastal impacts from the private and public sector throughout Chile, we anticipate oppor- tunities for marine biodiversity offset programs. In fact, the Chilean government has re- cently modified important aspects of environmental impact assessment policy to allow offsetting. In addition, it is in the process of revising the offset framework within a new biodiversity and protected area policy.

The funds from the fee are used by the government for tree-planting and forest restoration activities at a minimum ratio of one square meter mitigated for every square meter impacted. An interesting aspect of this program is that the categories of forest that must be compensated and the fee speci ed for each are not ecosystem-based, but rather are based on the forest-use zoning. For example, there are differing fees for impacts to ?economic forestland?, ?non-mature plantation forests?, and ?national key protected forestland?. It is unknown whether the fee collected must be used to offset with a ?like? category of forest. The program collected a total of RMB 8.044 billion from 2003-2005, or around RMB 2.7 billion annually (about US$393 million).5 To our knowledge, this program does not attempt to account for the ecological quality of the forest (Madsen et al. 2010).",,Implemented,,,"TenKate and Crowe 2014, Madsen et al. 2010","Adaptation of current EIA law so that the purpose of the compensation measures is to offset environmental

Compensation for secondary vegetation ranges between 0.01 and 0.02 square km for every square km affected. And in the case of natural ecosystems, it ranges from 0.02 to 0.1 square km for every square km affected.

Biodiversity offsetting is one of the six Innovative Financial Mechanisms outlined by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which entered into force in 1993 and has been ratified by 193 countries. The treaty is widely seen as the key document on sustainable development.

The other mechanisms are environmental fiscal reform, payments for ecosystem services, green markets, biodiversity in climate change funding, and biodiversity in international development finance.

Currently only one-fifth of the signatory countries have biodiversity offsetting mechanisms, and some 45 programmes are in operation, with an investment between 2.4 and 4.0 billion dollars (ISPnews.net)

The Nature Conservancy (TNC), Conservation International and WWF are working with the Colombian Ministry of Environment to apply TNC?s ?Development by Design? (DbD) framework. Although not an offset or compensation program in itself, the DbD approach will identify development impact and determine appropriate offsets with ecological equivalence.

Most countries in Latin America have existing Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) laws that address impact mitigation and many also feature examples of voluntary compensation programs. A majority of the programs tend towards government compensation rather than a market-based system for offsetting impacts to biodiversity. EIA laws requiring mitigation/compensation measures (though not necessarily true offsets) are in place in Argentina, Belize, Uruguay, and Panama.

Compensation for damage occurring in Natura 2000 sites is a legal requirement of the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.

Although some working group participants suggest the NNL Initiative should be
restricted to the terrestrial and freshwater environment, others considered it
should also extend to coastal and marine environments. The Strategy and Staff
Working Paper are silent on this issue. Coastal habitats, like many freshwater or
high altitude habitats, are very dynamic and subject to rapid and large-scale
shifts in their physical characteristics (e.g. through coastal erosion, flooding,
rock-fall) with important consequences for biodiversity. This creates specific
challenges to assessing impacts and designing appropriate offsets. The marine
environment presents some additional challenges in applying the mitigation
hierarchy and compensating for residual impacts although there is growing
experience in this in Europe and worldwide, not least from impact assessments
done for marine Natura 2000 sites. 32 It remains debatable whether knowledge is
sufficient to apply compensation in the marine environment in a comprehensive
and systematic way but there is nonetheless considerable potential for offsetting
some types of impacts (e.g. of coastal defences, ports and navigation, energy
infrastructure) in the marine environment, while ensuring additional gains with
regard to existing legal obligations under the MSFD and the nature directives.
Whilst re-creation per se of sea-bed habitats is very difficult, restoration or ?functional re-creation? measures and averted risk offsets33 both offer opportunities in the marine environment.

makers take a hard look at the potential environmental impacts of a proposed
project before allowing the project to proceed. Unlike the environmental
assessment process in the United States, which requires certain procedures and
processes but does not mandate any particular outcome, the EIA in Cuba is
substantive and drives the final decision on the environmental license. The need
for an EIA is triggered by an application for environmental license to the Center
for Inspection and Environmental Control (CICA) within CITMA. CICA
determines whether a proposed project or activity requires an EIA and its
discretion is guided by consideration of a number of factors including, human
health risks, adverse impacts to natural resources and ecosystem integrity,
impacts on scenic and tourism values; proximity to protected areas, and public
opinion of the proposal. Pursuant to Law 81 and Resolution 77/99, EIAs are
mandatory for most large construction projects and a range of activities
including, sewage storage, management and treatment facilities, mining, roads,
causeways and other transportation infrastructure, tourism facilities (in
particular those sited in coastal ecosystems), and any other ?activity occurring in
a fragile ecosystem that significantly alters the ecosystem, its composition or balance, or affects the population?s access to natural resources or the
environment in general.? 

was patterned in part after state laws in the U.S. and is designed to avoid and mitigate impacts to lands and waters from new construction and other activities.","An environmental impact assessment is demanded in cases of new projects, works,
activities, expansions or modifications of projects that use natural resources or any
source of energy. (Resolution No. 77 / 99 Regulatory Framework of the Process
of Environmental Impact Assessment of the Ministry of Science, Technology and
Environment).
Article 2 of the same regulatory instrument establishes that the government
institution responsible for the supervision of the Environmental Assessment System is
the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment and its representative offices in
the Cuban provinces.

Environmental monitoring of aquaculture farms
The Cuban legal framework does not explicitly oblige farmers to carry out environmental
monitoring plans. However there are a number of instruments aimed at exhorting
producers to comply with sustainable practices in their respective farms, the most
important being the Environmental Strategy (ES), which is a Plan of Action elaborated
at territorial, regional and sector levels. Fisheries authorities revise this plan of action
annually and a State environmental inspection is carried out systematically to farmers
to induce the compliance of the ES. ",,Potential,confirmed,,"Villarroya et al. 2014

Denmark,National,Europe,Yes,No,Yes,Explicit ,Offset,Biodiversity,Protection of Nature Act,Legislation,2009,Nature Conservation Act (No. 933 of 2009).,"The Protection of Nature Act (Naturbeskyttelsesloven, LBK nr 933 af 24/09/2009) stipulates that if a development project enters into conflict with the protection of a habitat mentioned in article 3, the project developer can obtain an exemption if it commits to offsetting the adverse effect of its project by recreating the affected habitat in another location. Article 3 lists a certain number of habitats such as peat bogs and marshes97. The majority of municipalities have adopted an informal rule
according to which the area of the recreated habitat must be twice that of the destroyed habitat. (Morandeau et al. 2012).

The Nature Conservation Act (modified in 1997 and 2004) provides Denmarks main legislative framework for nature conservation. It comprises four pillars: general protection for habitats; coastal zone protection; land acquisition; and specific regulatory powers for the protection of nature. Natura 2000 and Ramsar sites are established under this act. It proects: natural lakes of more than 100m2, watercourses or aeas of watercourses that have been designated as protected areas, heaths, bogs, marshes, moors. salt marshes, swamps, coastal meadows, humid permanent grassland and uncultivated dry grassland (OECD)

","The offsets implemented in Denmark almost exclusively concern protected habitats and species. Unprotected habitats and species (such as certain hedgerows, for example) can be indirectly concerned if maintaining them helps conserve protected
habitats and species (Morandeau et al)",,Established,,,Morandeau et al. 2012. Compensating for damage to biodiversity: an international benchmarking study; Vassierre et al. 2014. Windfarms; OECD. Environmental Performance Reviews: Denmark.,"Second, developers present positive impacts as offsetting the negative residual impacts of
the farms. However, neither the amount of loss of ecosystem functions due to negative
impacts nor the amount of gain of ecosystem functions due to positive impacts is estimated.
These ?measures? are not calculated and implemented to offset the impact; they are
?consequences? rather than real measures. For example, the Middelgrunden EIA report
(Denmark) notes that the operation phase of the farm will disturb resting and foraging birds
and will force them to keep at a distance from the turbines for resting and foraging. It then
claims that this negative impact can be counterbalanced by a positive one: mollusks growing
on the foundations will supply food, for example for diving ducks. The equivalency here is too
weak. The impacted birds will not come around the farm any longer, and the compensated
birds belong only to some species (diving ducks). Moreover, it is still a matter of debate
whether the reef effect or the reserve effect are truly positive. Lastly, whether the impact is
positive or negative is a question of interpretation or of perception [15], especially in the case
of unknown, not properly explained, or not monitored impacts. The precautionary principle is
hardly ever mentioned in the EIA reports. ",

The Municipality approved the creation of FONAG, after which the organizations began engaging large
water users in Quito to support the fund. Among the largest users engaged were the Quito Municipal Water and Sewage Agency (EMAAP-Q), Quito?s Electric Company (EEQ) (a key user of hydropower in the watersheds) and large beverage companies. EMAAP-Q eventually committed 1 percent of its monthly water sales to FONAG (generating approximately US$360,000/year), EEQ committed US$45,000/year and a privately owned beer company committed $6,000 / year (the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation also gave FONAG US$10,000 / year for two years).

The International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA)
was set up in 1974 following the establishment of the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP). IPIECA is a global association representing both the upstream and
downstream oil and gas industry on key global environmental and social issues. (1)
IPIECA has been addressing biodiversity issues since the early 1990s. In 2002, IPIECA
formed a Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Working Group (BESWG) with the
International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP), to improve the way the
industry recognizes and manages biodiversity impacts, and engages with society on
biodiversity conservation issues. Among other issues, it is working on integrating developing case-study examples to both communicate and illustrate industry action. (3)
In 2010, IPIECA and OGP published 10 tips for managing Biodiversity & Ecosystem
Services in the oil and gas industry. Each tip is supported by resources, many of which
are IPIECA/OGP documents. This includes clear adherence to the Mitigation Hierarchy:
?Systematically apply the Mitigation Hierarchy throughout the asset life-cycle to
follow an effective order of preference in addressing all potential impacts on BES of oil
and gas operations. The order of preference is: Avoid; Reduce; Restore, and, in cases
where significant residual biodiversity impacts remain, Offset.? (5)
This work of IPIECA is underpinned by case studies, e.g. the Villano oil field, operated
by Agip Oil Ecuador (AOE) in the Ecuadorian Amazon: Demonstrating no net loss by
integrating biodiversity management into operational practices based on sound
science: The VBD project provided science-based evidence for the mitigation
hierarchy as an effective framework to manage potential operational impacts and to
drive performance improvement in achieving NNL of biodiversity. A timely application
of the mitigation hierarchy (particularly avoidance) as early as possible in the project
life-cycle is key to achieving NNL when operating in forest environments. The
mitigation hierarchy should drive site selection and promote a smaller footprint in
designing projects, allowing successful and more cost-effective restoration. In turn
this can help to avoid or minimise the need for biodiversity offsets. (4) (Darbi et al. 2016)

A number of countries ? Egypt, Morocco, Uganda, South Africa, Rwanda, and Madagascar ? have Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) regulations, sectoral guidelines, or other policies in place providing a legal framework for compensation, though the mitigation hierarchy is typically not fully implemented or clearly defined (BBOP market watch africa)

(The Egypt State of the Environment Report goes along with this definition stating that ?biodiversity encompasses natural environments and habitats as well as flora, fauna and microbial species and the genetic resources included in each? (Ministry of State for Environmental Affairs 2007: 102)..... As noted above, EIA is the most commonly used instrument in Egypt for addressing compensation issues. Biodiversity is being considered in many EIAs reviewed by the EEAA. However the use of biodiversity considerations as an incentive measure is still limited (EEAA 2002: 40f). With about 12,000 EIAs conducted annually, EIA is an important environmental management tool in Egypt. Even
though the inclusion of biodiversity issues is considered of relatively high importance, economic development
objectives take priority in some cases (EEAA 2002: 45). (Darbi et al .2009).",

This is the methodological document on how to design and implement offset as required by the French law","No net loss, and ideally, net gain of natural habitats

Offsets are legally defined as measures that ?aim to offset the
significant negative effects, direct or indirect, of the project that could
not be avoided or sufficiently reduced. They are implemented in
priority on the damaged site or in proximity to it, so as to ensure its
functionality through time. They must ensure that the environmental
quality of habitats is globally maintained or, if possible, enhanced?

","Permits granted on the basis of an EIA must now include the mitigation measures presented in the EIA document, including avoidance, reduction and compensation or offset measures.
? Government guidance states that ?implementation of the mitigation hierarchy is intended to conserve the overall environmental quality of habitats, and if possible to achieve a net gain, in particular for degraded habitats, taking into account their sensitivity and general goals for achieving good conservation status of these habitats?. (TenKate and Crowe 2014)

Although changes in the French EIA procedures
have now detailed how other plans or projects must be taken into consideration at the project level, the issue remains that cumulative impacts are addressed through a ??first come, first served?? permitting process. This sets the stage for progressively lowering the thresholds beyond which additional impacts can no longer be considered negligible (i.e. ??death
by a thousand cuts??). Furthermore, no recommendations have been made to ensure compatibility between the data or
methods used for assessing impacts across projects.",,Established,,NNL or NG,Ten Kate and Crowe 2014; Ministry of Ecology Sustainable Development and Energy 2012; Quetier et al 2014; Darbi et al. 2016; Bas et al. 2016,EIA laws set up but compensation only used in certain types of development,

Although some working group participants suggest the NNL Initiative should be
restricted to the terrestrial and freshwater environment, others considered it
should also extend to coastal and marine environments. The Strategy and Staff
Working Paper are silent on this issue. Coastal habitats, like many freshwater or
high altitude habitats, are very dynamic and subject to rapid and large-scale
shifts in their physical characteristics (e.g. through coastal erosion, flooding,
rock-fall) with important consequences for biodiversity. This creates specific
challenges to assessing impacts and designing appropriate offsets. The marine
environment presents some additional challenges in applying the mitigation
hierarchy and compensating for residual impacts although there is growing
experience in this in Europe and worldwide, not least from impact assessments
done for marine Natura 2000 sites. 32 It remains debatable whether knowledge is
sufficient to apply compensation in the marine environment in a comprehensive
and systematic way but there is nonetheless considerable potential for offsetting
some types of impacts (e.g. of coastal defences, ports and navigation, energy
infrastructure) in the marine environment, while ensuring additional gains with
regard to existing legal obligations under the MSFD and the nature directives.
Whilst re-creation per se of sea-bed habitats is very difficult, restoration or ?functional re-creation? measures and averted risk offsets33 both offer opportunities in the marine environment. Similarly, although offsetting at the coast requires the resolution of different issues - not least reversibility questions associated with coastal erosion or with saline inundation34 - experience in coastal habitat restoration, creation and enhancement also continues to evolve.

http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/nnl/pdf/Subgroup_NNL_Scope_Objectives.pdf","In France, the mitigation hierarchy has been enshrined in environmental law since 1976.
More recently, in 2012 and 2013, as a result of the introduction of the Birds, Habitats, and Environmental Liability Directives in 1979, 1992, and 2004 respectively, the French government published guidance on the mitigation hierarchy, with no net loss as an explicit goal (Qu‚tier et al., 2014).

France has a requirement to compensate for negative environmental impacts stipulated in the environmental law since 1976. However, the French compensation requirement was never properly implemented until a set of reforms were introduced starting in 2007 as a result of a national consultative process on environmental policy (called ?Grenelle de l?Environnement?). To streamline offset implementation, France has launched a pilot habitat banking scheme and in 2008 the French ministry for the environment in cooperation with the private ?CDC Biodiversit‚? (a specialized subsidiary of a state-owned sovereign fund) started to implement a first pilot on biodiversity offsets, by restoring natural grasslands in the Crau area in Southern France (5). In June 2011 the French government chose to expand this pilot to several other regions and foster additional habitat banks. Furthermore, French offsetting requirements have been significantly strengthened by the issuance of a ?doctrine? on how to best avoid, reduce and offset (?sequence ERC? (1)) impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems (2) as well as accompanying guidelines (lignes directrices) in 2012. (3)
In 2016 the French national Assembly adopted a new biodiversity law (4), which now also includes the application of the mitigation hierarchy in order to reach the goal of No Net Loss (or preferably Net Gain) of biodiversity. Furthermore, the law allows for 3rd party providers of offsets (habitat banking) who will require the prior approval of the French authorities in order to be able to operate. he ?Lignes directrices nationales sur la s‚quence ‚viter, r‚duire et compenser les impacts sur les milieux naturels? state that if residual impacts remain after avoidance and minimization steps, compensation is mandatory in the case of damage resulting in ?major environmental issues?. Step?by?step recommendations are given as to how to go through the mitigation hierarchy when planning and implementing a project. 31 thematic spread sheets set out single steps or specific cases are presented in some detail, e.g. for marine environments. (Darbi et al. 2016).

A thorough review (Jacob et al.sub.) of about 50 EIAs carried out for coastal and marine projects in France also reveals that an additional pitfall of implementing mitigation measures for coastal and marine contexts lies in the unsuitability of the methodologies used to assess both the ecological losses liable to result from a development project and the ecological gains liable to be generated by an offset measure.(Bas et al. 2016).",

The analysis demonstrated that the impacts of exploration drilling are negligible to low on water and fish.
The magnitude of the drilling's effects on more sensitive and emblematic aspects (turtles, cetaceans and birds) was evaluated as low to medium.
The sediment around the drilling wells was identified as a compartment that was poor to medium affected by the prospecting operations, particularly through waste fluid and drilling excavation that disturbs the physics-chemistry and the nature of the sea-bed.
Measures were recommended to reduce (aiming to lower the time parameter linked to each effect) and environmentally monitor before and after drilling around the wells.http://creocean.fr/en/eia-marine-environment-french-guiana",

Germany already has a decades-old impact-mitigation regulation system at the national level for the purpose of achieving no net loss by means of avoidance, mitigation, compensation and offsetting for projects impacting upon nature and the landscape (Albrecht et al 2014

This mandatory system builds on the provisions in the 1976 Federal Nature Conservation Act [1] which sets the overall framework that is further elaborated in the nature conservation laws of the federal states. The IMR applies to developments and projects on all areas, scales of impact and sectors (excluding agriculture, forestry and fisheries) [2].
The overall objective is to ensure the preservation of the existing ecological situation as a minimum standard by avoiding any impairment of nature and landscape in general and more specifically, of the natural assets (species and habitats, soil, water, climate and air quality) as well as the aesthetic quality and the recreational function of the landscape, and compensating for residual unavoidable impacts through nature conservation and landscape management measures [1]. ","It covers all natural assets under the German Federal Nature Conservation Act, including projects at the levels of both urban planning and sectoral planning.The IMR has strict additionally requirements and is regulated by public conservation agencies. It was integrated with Federal Building and Spatial Planning regulations in the 1990s, which introduced greater market-style flexibility, a trend that continues through current reforms. Increased flexibility has led to the use of compensation pools, collectively providing compensation areas and measures. Compensation is undertaken as a result of damage identified in planning (and other) processes, and is generally organized through state planning authorities. At present, the control of the compensation processes via the state means it is not a fully functioning market, and as a result volume of the market is unknown (speciesbanking.com); 

The legal definition of the impact provides that an impact upon ?nature and landscape, as defined in this
Act, shall refer to any changes affecting the shape or use
of areas, or changes in the groundwater level associated
with the active soil layer, which may significantly impair
the performance and functioning of the natural balance or
landscape appearance?.23 The impact mitigation regulation procedure is determined in a so-called ?cascade of legal effects?:
? The requirement to refrain from avoidable impacts;24
? For unavoidable impacts, the requirement of either in-
kind/on-site compensation, or offsetting of the effects
of the impact;Where impairments are unavoidable, the balancing of
the interests relating to nature and the landscape on the
one hand, and to the interests of implementation of a
measure causing such an impact on the other;25
? if the impact is then approved, the party causing the
impact must provide additional monetary compensation
for the residual damage caused with regard to those
effects of the impact which cannot be avoided and must
therefore be compensated.26; The difference between offsetting and
compensation is thus clear: only an ?equivalent? offsetting
of the detrimentally affected function of the balance of
nature is required. That means that offsetting measures
need not necessarily be carried out at the site of the impact.
What is required however is a ?reference of the natural
space? to the site of the effect of the impact. Unlike the
general international use of the term, offset measures
(Ersatzmaánahmen) under German law are not limited
to biodiversity offsets, but also include the aesthetic
components, such as, inter alia, ecosystem and even
landscape quality-referenced offsets. (Albrecht et al 2014)",,Established,confirmed,NNL,"Madsen et al.; Speciesbanking.org; Darbi & Tausch.

forest's ""opportunity cost"", a tax to offset deforestation and the cost of the environmental losses (preservation of wildlife,
conservation of biodiversity, treatment of pollution, etc.).

the university work of the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai as a basis for the monetary valuation of the biodiversity of
Indian forests. This takes account of two types of service provided by the forest, namely the recreational value linked to the

In most countries, sector-specific laws have been introduced to preserve biodiversity components that present particular challenges, such as wetlands (Canada, Russia and the United States), forest (Brazil, India, the Netherlands, Morocco and Russia), protected spaces outside the Natura 2000 network (Denmark, Mexico, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, etc.); and protected species (Australia, the Netherlands and the United States). These sector-specific laws are either used to specify the offsetting obligations, or to impose the introduction of compensatory measures for the natural environments at stake. In India, for example, authorisation to establish a steelworks run by a Korean industrialist has been delayed by 5 years due to the insufficiency of proposed forestry offsets.....

and the Decree MECIE (Mise en Compatibilit‚ des Investissements avec l'Environnement) stipulating
the obligation to carry out an EIA for public and private investment projects (Office National
pour l?Environnement n.d.d: 5; MinistŠre de l?Environnement; Office National pour l?Environnement 2000: (Darbi et al. 2009)

Madagascar is also reported to be in the phase of 'developing' an offset policy. (GiBop 2018)"," A policy of net gain is promoted (?leaving better conditions than existed before the project began?), with the aim of replacing the historical approach of mining and hydrocarbon industries, when the implementation of mitigation policies meant restoring conditions to the state prior to the impact once a project had been completed (Darbi et al .2009 -Projet de Gouvernance des Ressources Minerales de
Madagascar n.d.a: 2).

In Madagascar general and specific mitigation and compensation measures are defined in the EIA guidelines.

The Environmental Action Plan introduced a number of methodological tools, among which the Environmental Impact Study (Etude d?Impact Environnemental, EIE) is considered to be the most de-
veloped tool in Madagascar, with more than hundred studies carried out for different public and private
projects (Ministere de l?Environnement, des Eaux et Forets n.d.: 17) (Darbi et al. 2009).
","Identification and assessment of environmental impacts: One of the objectives of the EIE is to identify the effects of a project so that adjustments can be made to limit adverse impacts (Office National pour l?Environnement n.d.a: 29). An environmental planning process has to be integrated into the overall project design, with the goal of minimising adverse environmental effects from the outset, while taking into consideration:
The protection of sensitive zones and those that are rich of biodiversity,
The minimisation of ecosystem and biological diversity deterioration and
The goal of achieving a placement solution, generating socio-economic benefits for the population (i.e. to assure the best social integration of the project) (Office National pour l?Environnement n.d.a: 29; MinistŠre de l?Environnement; Office National pour l?Environnement 2000: 18). According to the General EIA Directive the analysis of impacts has to consider the following: Identification and assessment of the probable environmental impacts related to the project,
Identification of measures to mitigate or prevent negative impacts on the environment, That the impact assessment implies a value judgement based on the valuation of the environmental components and the norms in force,
Security measures and The implementation of a programme for monitoring and follow-up during the different stages of the project and environmental management plan (MinistŠre de l?Environnement; Office National pour
l?Environnement 2000: 23f, 27)

The EIA Directive requires the prediction and identification of potential impacts, as well as the analysis and evaluation of the scale, importance and significance of the key effects. The scope of the studies depends on the gravity of the impacts, the vulnerability of the components of the environment that require protection, the nature and complexity of the project and available information relating to the site (MinistŠre de l?Environnement; Office National pour l?Environnement 2000: 12f). As the impact evaluation builds on a value judgement, the Directive notes that the evaluation criteria may be determined using a participatory approach and take into consideration the opinion of concerned parties
(MinistŠre de l?Environnement; Office National pour l?Environnement 2000: 24) (Darbi et al. 2009). 

An example is EIA in Mada-
gascar, where mitigation and compensation measures are presented together in the Project Environ-
mental Management Plan and include measures to (a) preserve important components of the biologi-
cal environment, (b) design and implement measures to minimise environmental impacts during con-
struction and operation, and (c) restore the site and to compensate for residual impacts. During project
implementation, environmental monitoring and follow up are used to assess the implementation of
protection and mitigation or compensation measures and to establish new mitigation or restoration
measures if necessary. The residual impacts that remain following the application of mitigation meas-
ures have to be defined and are then the subject of an environmental monitoring programme (see
Figure 45). After the evaluation and the analysis of the result, impacts are classified, which may lead to a distinction between:
Positive and negative,
Direct and indirect, and
Cumulative impacts (MinistŠre de l?Environnement; Office National pour l?Environnement 2000:
25). (Darbi et al)",,Preliminary,confirmed,,Darbi et al. 2009; Darbi et al. 2016; TenKate and Crow 2014; ,"(Table 13: Components of the biological environment according to the General EIA Guidelines: Types of existing ecosystems: terrestrial,

legislation confirmed, offset action unconfirmed - Also classed in this category are existing and planned regulations that specifically address biodiversity
offsets. For instance, although Madagascar has EIA regulations that could (but currently do not)
address biodiversity offsets, the country aims to develop a biodiversity offset policy for mining
and logging companies (Donswald et al. 2012) - Darbi et al. 2016 - offset projects being 'trialed' 

In Madagascar general and specific mitigation and compensation measures are defined
in the EIA guidelines. Furthermore, biodiversity offsets are being piloted in the mining
sector. (1) The mining sector has a significant position, given that the Madagascar
Action Plan (MAP) includes the goal of promoting biodiversity compensation
mechanisms for this sector (3). Furthermore the whole sector has undergone an EIA in
2003 (2). The mining sector also developed Good Governance and Asset Management
Principles to improve environmental performance and management of national assets
(3).
A policy of net gain is promoted (?leaving better conditions than existed before the
project began?), with the aim of replacing the historical approach of mining and
hydrocarbon industries, when the implementation of mitigation policies meant
restoring conditions to the state prior to the impact once a project had been completed
(3).
The mitigation of impacts (usually the term ?att‚nuation? is applied, only in some cases
is ?mitigation? used) consists of actions or measures to prevent, avoid or reduce
negative impacts or to increase benefits for the environment (4). Adequate mitigation
and / or compensation measures have to be determined for each stage of activity,
source of impacts, action or activity that has a negative influence on one or several
components of the environment (4, 5). This implies the development of strategies to
reduce adverse impacts and to consider (and / or choose) alternatives if these are less
harmful to the environment (4). Darbi et al. 2016

Madagascar, with high levels of endemism and biodiversity, has a long history of efforts to conserve its unique biomes. EIA regulations play an important role in Madagascar, providing guidelines for major projects and requiring the hierarchy of avoidance, minimization, and restoration, although there is no law requiring offsets for residual impacts to biodiversity. Although there is no national offset program, some voluntary projects have taken place, laying the groundwork for a future program. Two mining companies, Ambatovy and Rio Tinto, are currently creating biodiversity offsets for their projects on a voluntary basis in Madagascar (Ecosystem marketplace).",

Compensation for damage occurring in Natura 2000 sites is a legal requirement of the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.

Although some working group participants suggest the NNL Initiative should be
restricted to the terrestrial and freshwater environment, others considered it
should also extend to coastal and marine environments. The Strategy and Staff
Working Paper are silent on this issue. Coastal habitats, like many freshwater or
high altitude habitats, are very dynamic and subject to rapid and large-scale
shifts in their physical characteristics (e.g. through coastal erosion, flooding,
rock-fall) with important consequences for biodiversity. This creates specific
challenges to assessing impacts and designing appropriate offsets. The marine
environment presents some additional challenges in applying the mitigation
hierarchy and compensating for residual impacts although there is growing
experience in this in Europe and worldwide, not least from impact assessments
done for marine Natura 2000 sites. 32 It remains debatable whether knowledge is
sufficient to apply compensation in the marine environment in a comprehensive
and systematic way but there is nonetheless considerable potential for offsetting
some types of impacts (e.g. of coastal defences, ports and navigation, energy
infrastructure) in the marine environment, while ensuring additional gains with
regard to existing legal obligations under the MSFD and the nature directives.
Whilst re-creation per se of sea-bed habitats is very difficult, restoration or ?functional re-creation? measures and averted risk offsets33 both offer opportunities in the marine environment. Similarly, although offsetting at the coast requires the resolution of different issues - not least reversibility questions associated with coastal erosion or with saline inundation34 - experience in coastal habitat restoration, creation and enhancement also continues to evolve. Further there may be opportunities to compensate for some marine activities by offsetting in the coastal environment.",,,In Progress,confirmed,NNL,"Tucker, Graham; Allen, Ben; Conway,

In 2008, the government of Sabah, Malaysia teamed up with the Eco Products Fund, a private equity investment vehicle jointly managed by New Forests Inc. and Equator Environmental, LLC, to invest up to US $10 million in the restoration and maintenance of 34,000 hectares of rainforest in a project called the Malua BioBank. The project sells ""biodiversity conservation certificates for the biodiversity benefits of 100 square meter plots of restoration as well as for the maintenance of habitat for at least 50 years. The project is unique for enabling the long-term (and potentially permanent) protection of biodiversity via a voluntary purchase. Additionally, the project provides transparency through a third party registry. Early buyers have included businesses and non-profits from a range of industries, such as tourism, timber, and palm oil. The Malua BioBank is offering to link the conservation credits to companies' specific products or supply chains, and the BioBank is also starting to develop biodiversity offset products where a company is seeking to quantify offset measurable conservation impacts.",

Neither of these two laws can be considered a specific offset framework since they only enable the

If an EIA is required, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is issued, consisting of separate mitigation, compensation and follow-up measures for development activities, and distinguishing on-site and off-site actions. The current system allow a choice of creating an offset (eg PEMEX Jaguaroundi project) or paying into compensation fund managed by the National Forestry Commission (Comisi¢n Nacional Forestal, CONAFOR) at a raio of greater than 1:1 (Conafor sets the ratio and completes reforestation activities).

The General Act on Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental Protection (LGEEPA), which
regulates the principles of the constitution in relation to environmental matters, includes the legal definitions of these ANPs, classifying them into six different categories: biosphere reserves, national  International Approaches to compensation for Impacts on Biological Diversity Final Report, February 2009 115 parks, marine national parks, areas for the protection of flora and fauna, special biosphere reserves, and natural monuments (Nadal 2001: 4). The system of natural protected areas is complemented by natural protected ecosystems under the UMA Pilot Programme9 that aims to integrate the ecosystem
approach of the CBD with the political system in the context of conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity (CBD 2006: 9).(Darbi et al.2009).

In contrast to other Latin American countries, Mexico has well developed environmental politics. Instruments for avoidance, minimisation and compensation are modelled on the US example. On-site measures (rehabilitation) and off-site  International Approaches to compensation for Impacts on 
38 measures (measures of equal value) are distinguished under Mexican EIAs. At the national level, the Administration Programme for Environmental Justice identifies the most important regions, which are those affected by adverse impacts arising from the activities of different sectors, and requires restoration, rehabilitation and / or compensation as appropriate (Darbi et al.2009

 Art. 2.60 of the Biodiversity Code, concerns environmental politics and its instruments and establishes a number of criteria. Firstly, the preservation and conservation of the ecological balance and the internalisation of costs are indispensable to the conservation of the environment, biodiversity and natural  International Approaches to compensation for Impacts on Biological Diversity Final Report, February 2009 114 resources. Secondly, the restoration, remediation, recovery and rehabilitation of the ecological balance are essential in order to face climate-related challenges and to stop desertification, erosion and salinisation
of soils as well as the disappearance of flora and fauna (Estado de Mexico 2005: 45f).
Furthermore, Art. 2.82 introduces the obligation for all stakeholders, including state and municipal authorities, the social sector and private organisations, communities and any individual, to act in a way that preserves, conserves, remediates, rehabilitates, recovers, restores and protects natural protected areas, biological diversity and its ecosystems (Estado de Mexico 2005: 52). (Darbi et al. 2009).

Cumulative/Indirect Impacts and Impact Significance: Several countries make provisions for evaluating strategic development plans under their general EIA regulations (Chile, Decree 40 of 2013; Peru, Supreme Decree 019-2009-MINAM; Mexico, LGEEPA of 1988; Venezuela, Decree 1257 of 1996).

offsets in Mozambique, despite existing constraints of data deficiency, institutional immaturity, and underdeveloped human capacity. The Roadmap and its recommendations must be viewed from this perspective. Industrial development will not wait for perfect biological knowledge to be obtained first. Even with constraints, No Net Loss is a valuable goal to aim for and a useful tool for helping the national Government to achieve its biodiversity objectives.

The Environmental Law is the overarching legal framework for environmental matters in Mozambique. Particularly relevant here for NNL is article 4, which discusses the general principles, specifically Principle 7 (the principle of Responsibility), on the basis of which 'whoever pollutes or in any way degrades the environment shall always have the obligation to repair or compensate for the resulting damage.' While no regulations are in place to implement this provision as of yet, this is an important starting point. Article 15 of the same law decrees that the issuance of an Environmental License precedes the issuance of any other commercial license. Since the license itself is only granted after the completion of an environmental and social assessment process, this is very strong protection for the environment and opens the space for inserting offset design into the process (World Bank 2016).

Environmental Impact Assessment Legislation. The current regulations for environmental and social impact assessment are predominantly contained in Decree 24/2004, although some sectors such as mining (Decree 26/2004) and petroleum (Decree 56/2010) have their own specific decrees with additional details. (World Bank 2016).","According to these legal instruments, the Mozambican environmental and social assessment process is supposed to: 

A. Analyse the project
B. Classify it, based on expected impacts, into one of three categories, with different levels of environmental impact assessment rigor required for each;
C. Identify all environmental impacts (quantitatively or at least qualitatively);
D. Require the propoent to develop mitigation masures (following the mitigation hierarchy);
E. Require the preparation of an Environmental Management Plan; and
F. Require a compensation Plan (but usually only for social impacts) (World bank 2016).

Once the applicable environmental documents are approved, the corresponding plan then became part of the project's speficif legal framework, and compliance with the applicable conditions becomes a binding requirement on the project developer. From a biodiversity offsets point of view, this means that if an Environmental Management Plan stipulates that an offset will be carried out, then this becomes mandatory for the development, even if the project is sold to another company.

The specific environmental regulations for the petroleum sector (Decree 56/2010) require the relevant Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to include the possibility of rehabilitation and compensation of negative environmental effects. as well as requiring that the cumulative impacts be taken into account. Although Moazambican EIAs have thus far mostly not complied with this requirement - partly due to lack of clear guidance on the acceptable mechanisms for doing so-biodiversity offsets are clearly an available tool to realize this obligation (World Bank 2016).",,In Progress,confirmed,NNL,World Bank Report.2016.  Biodiversity offsets in Mozambique - A Roadmap for implementation," In Egypt and several other countries like Morocco and Senegal the focus is the EIA system (Darbi et al. 2009). 

In most countries, sector-specific laws have been introduced to preserve biodiversity components that present particular challenges, such as wetlands (Canada, Russia and the United States), forest (Brazil, India, the Netherlands, Morocco and Russia) (Morandeau and Vilaysack 2012).

Regulatory drivers for biodiversity compensation are still in development across much of Africa. A number of countries ? Egypt, Morocco, Uganda, South Africa, Rwanda, and Madagascar ? have Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) regulations, sectoral guidelines, or other policies in place providing a legal framework for compensation, though the mitigation hierarchy is typically not fully implemented or clearly defined (ecosystem marketplace).",

this has been the construction of dams along the Zambezi River. Dam construction moderated the

also increased risks to human settlement. This is because dam managers retain water in the early
part of the rainy season to make sure that the dam will actually fill. In years with late rain, the
dams get too full and water is released causing late season flooding downstream. Indirect effects
of this kind could also affect ?No Go? areas (and natural and critical habitat for that matter), and so

Some measures for offsetting environmental residual impacts are presented in the EIA reports, but their equivalency and appropriateness need to be examined. First, some onshore measures are proposed to offset offshore impacts. For instance, the Netherlands government asked the Egmond aan Zee offshore wind farm (Netherlands) for a
?compensation plan for nature value? in order to offset the possible impact on the marineenvironment, in response to two appeals brought by an environmental association and an association protesting against the farm. The cost of the plan represented 0.2% of the total cost of the project. The six proposed measures were:
1. Expansion of De Putten bird reserve for coastal and migratory birds.
2. Fund for the benefit of (migratory) birds and marine organisms.
3. Decontaminating a former transmitting station for the benefit of the dune landscape.
4. Nature restoration of wet dune valley near Diederik parking lot at Egmond-Binnen.
5. A documentary film on nature and marine reserves in the North Sea to emphasize the beauty of the sea.
6. Support for initiative for fishing for litter.
There is a problem of equivalency here. Onshore measures are proposed for offshore impacts, and land-based, even coastal, functions are not the same as marine ones. Some measures address impacts other than those of the wind farm project. (Vaisierre et al)

In the Netherlands, the pressure of nature conservation associations is leading some project developers to voluntarily
implement offsetting. By way of example, within the framework of the proposed urban extension to the municipality ofAlmere (province of North Holland), local nature conservation associations have exerted pressure on the project developers to reafforest even though they were not legally obliged to offset. (Morandeau and Villaysack 2012)

Another assessment available in the Netherlands: an evaluation conducted by the Court of Audits in 2009 of the
implementation of offsetting in two Dutch provinces, underlines that the provincial authorities do not sufficiently guarantee that the compensatory measure is implemented appropriately, transparently or on time, or managed over the long term to avoid a net loss of the quality of the nature. According to another evaluation conducted in 2006 by the Inspectorate of the former Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM), of 40 projects providing offsets, 6 had effectively implemented the measures, 16 had partially implemented them and 18 had not implemented the prescribed measures at all. 

 In the Netherlands, where the amounts paid by the project developers into the Dutch National Fund for Rural Areas are intended to ensure offsetting ?in-kind? by the project developers themselves, the sums tend not to move (141 million Euros in 2008, 131 million Euros in 2009) due to the difficulty project developers have in identifying offset sites and meeting requirements relating to equivalence (Morandeau and Villaysack 2012).

? several laws in place in NZ under which biodiversity offsetting may be relevant.
? In most cases, formulating and proposing a biodiversity offset to address adverse effects will be a choice by the applicant as a means of meeting or exceeding statutory tests
? Relevance of biodiversity offsetting and its applicability will be different under each Act ? Biodiversity offsetting is not explicitly required under any legislation however can be applicable under specific settings and the legislation allows for such measures to be taken.
? Biodiversity offsetting and compensation are two different things.

? Extracts under the Resource Management Act that says no mandatory offset but offset are possible:
?The RMA requires that adverse effects be avoided, remedied or mitigated. However, there is no requirement in the Act to achieve a no net loss outcome in order for a resource consent to be granted. Instead, the decision-maker would generally weigh-up the wide range of matters described above and make an overall broad judgement as to whether a particular proposal meets the requirements of the RMA.? (from NZ?s official guidance on biodiversity offsetting)

? Under the Conservation Act, offset application is highly limited or not possible:
?The primary differences between the CA and the RMA with regard to biodiversity offsetting are:
? The RMA requires decision-makers to take a broad overall judgement which is likely to include social and economic benefits. Such considerations cannot be taken into account under the CA;
? The CA focuses on the values of the land affected whereas the RMA considers the environment more broadly; and
? There are statutory bars to granting concessions that cannot be met using a biodiversity offset.
These differences limit the use of offsetting under the CA.? (from NZ?s official guidance on biodiversity offsetting)

? Under the CMA, may be possible if the Minister would consider it:
?Although there are no statutory criteria around whether or not, or in what circumstances, offsetting is appropriate and sufficient in the context of a proposed access arrangement, a biodiversity offset can be considered by the Minister(s) as a matter of relevance alongside other factors.? (from NZ?s official guidance on biodiversity offsetting) (GiBOP 2018)","Purpose of the RMA - section 5: The purpose of this Act is to promote the sustainable management of natural and physical resources. 
- Developed in response to international environmental agreements

The goal of the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy is to halt and, ultimately, reverse the decline in New Zealand?s indigenous biodiversity. Significant progress has been made in understanding, managing and reducing the threats to and loss of our biodiversity in the last few decades... Biodiversity offsetting in New Zealand should take into account the above context and the design of offsets needs to address the drivers of indigenous biodiversity loss and the tools available to achieve biodiversity gains (NZ Govt. 2014).

ew Zealand has no law relating to offsets, but according to an assessment of the Ministry for the Environment they have been implemented in certain situations in accordance with the New Zealand Resource Management Act 1991. The objective of this act is to ensure sustainable management121 ""of natural and physical resources"", including by offsetting any adverse effect of activities on the environment (Morandeau et al 2012).","The first step in designing an offset is to adequately describe the biodiversity that will
be destroyed or modified by the development, either directly or indirectly, including
collecting data on what is there. Calculating no net loss requires choosing a currency
that can be used to categorise biodiversity into units to describe what has been lost
and gained. Inevitably, this requires simplification of the biodiversity and may involve
using proxies/surrogates or other recognised scientific approaches (NZ Govt).

This section of the Guidance focuses on the steps necessary when designing a
biodiversity offset, the key components of which are:
1. The goal: no net loss and preferably a net gain in biodiversity;
2. Describing the biodiversity: what to count and measure at the impact and offset sites;
3. Choosing a currency: to allow biodiversity to be categorised and exchanged;
4. The accounting framework: to help define the size, specification, location and successful implementation of the offset; and
5. Demonstrating additionality: how biodiversity gains are achieved and demonstrated at the offset site.
The goal of biodiversity offsetting is to achieve no net loss and, preferably, a net gain
of biodiversity on the ground, with respect to:
? Species composition (e.g. individual species or species groups)
? Habitat structure (e.g. vegetation tiers)
? Ecosystem function (e.g. nutrient cycling rates)
? People?s use of and cultural values associated with biodiversity (e.g. particularly valued habitats or species). 13
No net loss, in essence, refers to the point at which biodiversity gains from targeted
biodiversity management activities match the losses of biodiversity due to the
impacts of a specific development project, so that there is no net reduction in the
type, amount and condition (quality) of biodiversity. A net gain means that
biodiversity gains exceed a specific set of losses associated with a development.  (NZ Govt 2014).

In New Zealand the EIA Act stipulates only avoidance, remediation and mitigation (no compensation). Nothwithstanding this omission, regional scale district plans may stipulate under which certain environment resources may be used. Under these stipulations there are examples of compensation measures being applied (Darbi et al. 2009).","For the duration of the

Curiously, these regulations came previous to the creation of The General Law of Environment and NAtural Resources in 1996. When this Law was created, it respected and incorporated the Regulations for Permits and Environmental Impact Assessment of  1994, and considered it to be one of the instruments of environmental management. It also created a new milestone with respoect to the environment, as before this Geral Law environment was not considered in sectoral law for an intefrated point of view.

Regional, district, and local council plans have moved policy towards environmental and biodiversity banking by supporting the avoidance, remedy, and mitigation requirements in the RMA, and the act?s other offset-relevant components. In particular, Waikato?s proposed District Plan took legal effect in 2004 and is progressing to fully operational status. Adoption of the mitigation hierarchy allows development on areas of biodiversity in Waikato, but adverse effects should be remedied or mitigated at that site, or offset by conservation at another site of similar ecosystem type.117 Also, the Gisborne District Council Combined Regional Land and District Plan recognizes biodiversity and ecosystem impacts through their soil erosion policy linked to vegetation degradation and clearance. Mitigation proposals will be considered when obtaining council certification for works. Rules for implementing avoidance, remedy or mitigation will also be developed, in line with regional plan requirements.118
Although the regional examples above note some movement in adopting offsets and addressing biodiversity impacts at the local level, this has not been the case across the entire country. To step up more widespread adoption, a National Biodiversity Policy Statement has been drafted which is projected to be New Zealand?s first national guidance on offsetting. The policy is akin to legislation in terms of its strength under the RMA and would compel implementation at the level of councils and local authorities.119 Assuming a smooth consultation process, the policy could be gazetted as early as June this year. The policy reinforces avoidance, remedying, and then mitigation, with offsetting to occur as off-site mitigation for residual adverse impacts. Offsets must be focused on a ?no net loss? framework, with certain high-value sites or components exempt from offsetting.120 The policy statement contains language making biodiversity a distinct aspect of the environment to consider during the development process, alongside other functions such as landscape, amenity, or recreational values (Madsen et al. 2011).

 Marine Resources Act",unable to determine,"In sections 8 to 12, the law sets the principles applicable to official decision-making. The decision to authorise a development project must notably take into consideration the objectives of managing the habitat types and ecosystems as well as the objectives of managing species as presented in sections 4 and 5 of the law. However, offsetting residual impacts on biodiversity is not automatic. The public authority authorising the project must decide, when granting the permit, whether or not an offset will be required. For example, at project level, the project developer may be asked to bear reasonable costs linked to the maintenance, establishment or development of a targeted habitat type. At plan and programme level, when the decision is made in compliance with the law on planning and construction to classify a parcel of land as an industrial area, the decision may require part of the area concerned to be reclassed as a protected area120 and clear criteria to promote biodiversity to be included in the planning decision.
The decision-making process is based on the user pays principle as described in section 11 of the Nature Diversity Act. This principle means that any costs associated with preventing or limiting the impact caused by a project must be borne by the project developer, unless this is unreasonable in view of the nature of the project and its impacts.
Offsets apply equally to protected spaces and species, within the framework of requests to waive their protection, and unprotected biodiversity under the user pays principle. They can be provided both via ecological measures (?in-kind?) and financial transfers.
In the event of an infraction, in addition to other possible sanctions such as a fine, the project developer may be required to pay environmental compensation, the amount of which is calculated based on a global assessment of the value of the environmental components, and the extent and duration of the environmental impacts (Morandeau et al. 2012).

The competent authority under the Act may order the person responsible to remedy or stop situations that are contrary to the Act or decisions made under the Act.
Any person who by contravening the Act or a decision made under the Act causes a risk of reducing biological, geological or landscape diversity shall take measures to prevent such reduction. If such reduction has already occurred, the duty consists of preventing further reduction and ? if possible - restoring the original state of diversity by taking appropriate action such as collection, clearing up, removal or levelling the ground. Measures that in themselves may result in any significant reduction of diversity shall only be taken with the consent of the competent authority under the Act or by order under the first paragraph.
The duty to take preventive, remedial or restorative action does not apply to the extent that it would be particularly unreasonable in the light of the cost and effects of the measures, the environmental impacts of the contravention and the offender?s fault and financial situation.
Measures implemented under this section may consist of the killing of alien organisms to which the contravention relates or the return of living organisms to their original location (Nature Diversity Act).",Unable to determine,In Progress,confirmed,,"Morandeau et al. 2012; TenKate et al. 2014; Bull et al. 2013; Cole 2010

financial transfers considered to be an offset method in their own right, equal to the measures ?in-kind? implemented by the project developer. This is the case in India (CAMPA9), Brazil (National System of Conservation Units10), the United States (in-lieu fee programme11), the state of South Australia (Native Vegetation and Scattered Trees Offsets Program), Norway and Russia (Morandeau et al. 2012). 

The Nature Diversity Act, a central law relating to impacts on biodiversity in Norway, came into force on 1 July 2009. It has only recently been implemented and the interpretation of certain aspects relating to offsets is the subject of discussions. For example, the Ministry of the Environment is unsure of when an exemption to the conservation of protected species can be granted to guarantee an equivalent protected area is established in another location (Morandeau et al. 2012).

(Panama listed in Table 1 as having a 'Planned or Potential' Offset/Compensation law or regulation. Annex 1: Panama:Protected area compensation scheme; EIA in place but no current offset, PES scheme (Donswald et al. 2012) 

Costa Rica and Panama both have Payments for Environmental Services strategies related to the reduction or avoidance of adverse biodiversity impacts that could lay the groundwork for future offset programs.
The UNDP is currently conducting a study assessing the outlook for habitat banking and wetland mitigation in Latin America and the Caribbean, hoping to identify those areas with the most potential. It is focusing on nine case study countries including Panama, Chile, Peru, Costa Rica and Mexico.23 (Madsen et al.2010)



Previous studies by Tanaka in 2010 [38] and The Biodiversity Consultancy in 2013 [39] identified 56 countries in the world that have or are developing national legislation or policies around offsets. In Latin America five territories required the use of offsets (Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, Mexico and Paraguay), nine enabled the use of this tool (Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Guyana, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Uruguay and Vene- zuela), and three were developing policies related to offsets (Bahamas, Chile, Belize and Peru).: 
Argentina, Colombia, Panama and Peru were given a Tier 2 rating, which indicates that some elements and encouraging initiatives are in place although regulatory additions are needed.  Risks are present and should be mitigated prior to the implementation of a banking scheme; otherwise these could have a critical impact on
scheme development..... Policy and regulatory foundations The consultation process indicates that whilst national policy supports habitat conservation within protected areas,
outside of this network there are very few mechanisms available to conserve land threatened by the rise in demand for land for tourism and real estate development. The major compensatory activities for natural habitat impacts have been
implemented within the national park network, largely due to the fact that the regulation restricting biodiversity and
ecosystem service impacts only applies to these areas (category III impacts). Panama is still yet to assess and
prioritise those areas that require careful development management so that potential ?limits? are put on development. Scope for integration with EIA and permitting process
In its current form national EIA and permitting regulations would not provide sufficient support for a regulatory-based
HB system. EIA law does not require any form of ?like for like? ecological compensation. However, for impacts within
protected areas there have been individual examples of compensation through restoration and reforestation activities
within the same ecosystem service area, for example during the widening of the Panama Canal by the National Canal
Authority. Gap analysis assessments of the current protected area network have been recognised at government level
but there has been a lack of resources and political will to address these gaps. A HB scheme may be able to provide
the resources to fill these gaps using market mechanisms.  (Bovarnick et al. 2010).  ",

supporting countries as they improve the application of the mitigation hierarchy and

offsets. Examples include Uzbekhistan [5], Sabah [6], Papua New Guinea [7] and South

Despite avoidance, minimisation and restoration actions, the project expects to have a residual impact on identified critical habitat. In planning how to offset this residual impact, PNGLNG recognised that:
1. Papua New Guinea has no system, formal or otherwise, guiding the development of an offset plan.
2. Programs developed in jurisdictions with fragmented and degraded landscapes elsewhere have
limited relevance in extensively forested tropical landscapes such as those in PNG.
3. Acquiring or managing land as an offset is not a likely option because most land in PNG is subject to various forms of customary, and hence inalienable, tenure and there is little land solely controlled by government.
4. Landholders successfully practice subsistence shifting cultivation; hence, to acquire lands for a
biodiversity offset project would likely affect landholders? livelihoods.
5. There are limited offset opportunities on government-controlled lands in the Upstream Project Area.
6. Non-forested lands that may warrant restoration are rare in the Upstream Project Area and are
mostly restricted to roadsides. Non-forested land is part of the population?s agricultural base and
provides for part of their livelihoods. Thus, there is little potential for undertaking offset projects on
this type of land.
7. Protected area establishment and management in PNG is difficult because most land is in customary tenure.
PNGLNG is still resolving these challenges in consultation with the PNG government and a wide range of stakeholders.

Also Supreme Decree 019-2009-MINAM - Cumulative/Indirect Impacts and Impact Significance (Villaroya et al. 2014).

In Peru, the National System for Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA) law requires large-scale projects classified as category III and subject to a detailed- EIA to offset, when appropriate, their environmental impact (art. 10 Law 27446).  In 2014, the government approved ?Guidance for Environmental offset under the SEIA framework? (Ministerial Resolution 398-2014-MINAM), which sets general provisions including the scope, concepts, principles, criteria and minimum requirements of the environmental offer plan.  

According to Law 27446, Category III projects are those which characteristics, magnitude and location may cause significant negative environmental impacts. 

In 2016, the Ministry of Environment enacted the ?General guidance for the Environmental compensation Plan? (Ministerial Resolution N§ 066-2016-MINAM). This guidance is the most-up-to-date regulation regarding offset in Peru and complements the provisions sets by the 2014 regulation, including among other, criteria for the selection of offset sites, criteria to estimate losses and gains of biodiversity, and detailed provisions about the minimum information that an offset plans may include.  The same year, the Ministry approved ?Complementary guidance for environmental offset in the high-Andean ecosystem? (Ministerial Resolution N§ 183-2016-MINAM) that establishes the steps to follow and the methodology to calculate losses and gains of biodiversity in the high-Andean ecosystems (pagoda, toolbar and puma grass).

Although the law is not currently enacted, we have included it in this study since it establishes a new offset framework that is different from the other country level programs. The proposed law establishes that the developer be responsible for implementing the required offsets. Offsets are not required to be integrated into existing conservation priorities. While the law enables the developer to directly implement offsets, it also makes provisions for the creation of conservation banks. only Peru explicitly requires demonstrable gains that ensure that the offsetting process results in additional conservation outcomes.

- Environmental law (2002).
""Environmental protection"" is the activity of governmental bodies of the Russian Federation, governmental bodies of Russian regions, local government bodies, public and other non- commercial associations, legal entities and natural persons aimed at preserving and restoring natural environment, rational use and reproduction of natural resources, prevention of ? negative effect of economic and other activities on the environment and elimination of the consequences of such effects (hereinafter also referred to as ""natural environment preservation activity"")"".
The law includes the EIA. (GiBop 2018)",,"General provisions on offsetting environmental impacts, including on fauna and ecosystems, are regulated by article 77 of
federal law No. 7 of 10 January 2002 ""on protection of the environment"": moral and physical persons responsible for
environmental impacts produced by the pollution, impoverishment, destruction and irrational exploitation of natural resources,
damage and rupture of the equilibrium of natural ecological systems or impacts on landscapes, and any other threat to the law
in the domain of the environment, are obliged to fully offset them in compliance with the legislation. Nonetheless, the
legislation is ambiguous as article 78 stipulates that environmental offsets are implemented on a voluntary basis or based on
notification of a court judgement. Under the terms of Russian legislation, the development of green spaces is considered to be
one method of offsetting environmental impacts.
Impacts on specific components of the environment and on biodiversity are also regulated by:
article 56 of federal law No. 52 of 24 April 1995 ""on wildlife"";
article 100 of federal law No. 200 of the Forest Code of the Russian Federation of 4 December 2006;
article 69 of federal law No. 74 of the Water Code of the Russian Federation of 3 June 2006;
article 53 of federal law No. 166 of 20 December 2004 ""on fisheries and conservation of aquatic biological resources"".
In theory, offsets relate to all species of fauna and flora. They can be implemented via measures in-kind or via financial
transfers. The latter are paid into the account of the municipal budget in accordance with Budget Code N 145 of the Russian
Federation of 31 July 1998, and are not assigned as targeted compensation. The calculation of the amount does not take into
consideration the actual level of the impacts or the cost of the measures to restore habitats, but is essentially based on the
number of species concerned according to the methods and taxes approved by the authorities. In some cases, these financial
transfers are not intended to fund biodiversity offsets. For example, financial resources intended to offset the effect on the
biological resources of aquatic environments are used by the Federal Fisheries Agency to develop the business of aquacultural
enterprises, and not to safeguard the biodiversity of these areas (Morandeau and Villaysak 2012).

In 14 of the countries studied, financial transfers may be substituted for offsets. In other words, a project developer is allowed to pay a sum as a means of offsetting, and does not then need to account for the suitability or successful implementation of the measures planned in light of the residual impacts of its project. Financial transfers have different configurations in different
countries. A distinction is made between:...financial transfers considered to be an offset method in their own right, equal to the measures ?in-kind? implemented
by the project developer. This is the case in India (CAMPA9), Brazil (National System of Conservation Units10), the United States (in-lieu fee programme11), the state of South Australia (Native Vegetation and Scattered Trees Offsets
Program), Norway and Russia....In Russia, financial transfers are not necessarily allocated to ecological measures: for example, transfers intended to offset
impacts on biological resources in aquatic environments are used by the Federal Fisheries Agency to develop the activity of
aquacultural industrialists and not to safeguard the biodiversity of these areas(Morandeau and Villaysak 2012)..",unable to determine,In Progress,confirmed,,Morandeau and Villaysak 2012.,"In most countries, sector-specific laws have been introduced to preserve biodiversity components that present particular challenges, such as wetlands (Canada, Russia and the United States),",

In other words, a project developer is allowed to pay a sum as a means of offsetting, and does not then need to account for the suitability or successful implementation of the measures planned in light of the residual impacts of its project. Financial transfers have different configurations in different
countries. A distinction is made between: financial transfers tolerated but ranked below measures ?in-kind?, as is the case in the Netherlands (Fauna and Flora Act and Forest Act), Slovenia, Quebec (Canada), New Zealand, Morocco and Queensland, Australia (Marine Fish Habitat Offsets Program); (Morandeau and Villaysack 2012)",,Established,confirmed,NNL,"Tucker, Graham; Allen, Ben; Conway,

Offsets therefore focus on protected habitats and species. In the Natura 2000 area, which covers 35% of the national territory, offsets can also relate to unprotected biodiversity. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment defends a concentrated development policy and rejects projects that lead to the fragmentation of habitats. Of the 30% of projects giving rise to offsets, 90% of the measures prescribed are effectively implemented. (2011 survey of economic services on offsetting). Although financial transfers are authorised, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment is not in favour of them as they do
not allow the project developers to be held responsible. The Ministry insists its recommendations are heard, particularly in the alpine region, where the municipalities are in favour of proposals of financial compensation faced with the high pressure on natural habitats (tourism complexes).",

General Environmental Law: National Environmental Management Act 107 (1998) : no word on 'compensation/compensate/offset'. Mitigation is used in a broad context. However, as reported by FFI in its review of SA's biodiversity offset policies, the word 'remedy' in this legislation is what is understood by regulators to be the justification to request for biodiversity offset as part of the EIA process without a standalone regulation or explicit requirement regarding offset.

Provincial Offset Guideline:

Western Cape Offset Guideline

Both require the need for offset to be identified during the EIA process following the mitigation hierarchy in accordance with NEMA (FFI, 2015)

SOUTH AFRICA?S FIFTH NATIONAL REPORT TO THE CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. 2014. https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/za/za-nr-05-en.pdf","The South-African province of the Western Cape set-up a framework
for offsetting impacts on biodiversity that does not aim for
no-net-loss (Brownlie and Botha, 2009). Offset requirements are
instead attached to an amount of acceptable loss of threatened
vegetation types within a region (Department of Environmental Affairs
and Development Planning, 2007) (Quieter et al. 2011).

Guidelines have been published for two of South Africa?s nine provinces: the Western
Cape (3) and KwaZulu-Natal (Error! Reference source not found.). The Western Cape?s
Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning (DEA&DP) has
developed guidelines for biodiversity specialist studies conducted as part of the EIA. In
2007, it also released an Information Document on Biodiversity Offsetsin 2007 (3).
DEA&DP is currently revising its guidance and has called for more research on public
finance and administration of the system (5). (Darbi et al. 2016). ",

(See Qu‚tier, 2011)","the emphasis is on adding priority habitats to the conservation estate,
rather than on achieving ?no net loss? in the strictest sense? (Brownlie and Botha, 2009).

Offsets must consider all significant impacts on biodiversity: direct, indirect and cumulative impacts.

The NSBA establishes status for terrestrial, inland water, estuarine and marine
ecosystems, protection levels and conservation priorities at a 1: 250000 scale
nationally and suggested implementation options for priority areas. It provides the
national context for development of biodiversity plans at the sub-national and local
scale. For each vegetation type a defensible target has been determined, based
on protecting 75% of species occurring in that vegetation type. Ecosystem status is
thus based on the percentage of the original area remaining untransformed in
relation to the biodiversity target, and a threshold for ecosystem functioning.
Conservation priority areas indicate where there is a need for finer scale planning,
expansion of the protected area system and integration of biodiversity-compatible
development and resource management across the landscape and seascape,
including on private and communal land (Brownlie and Botha 2009). ",,Established,,,"Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning. 2007. Provincial Guideline on Biodiversity Offsets.

However, the inclusion of biodiversity offsetting as a condition of authorisation for individual projects is enabled through the EIA regulations under the National Environment Management Act (NEMA 1998) (1, 2)...
Guidelines have been published for two of South Africa?s nine provinces: the Western Cape (3) and KwaZulu-Natal (Error! Reference source not found.). The Western Cape?s Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning (DEA&DP) has developed guidelines for biodiversity specialist studies conducted as part of the EIA. In 2007, it also released an Information Document on Biodiversity Offsetsin 2007 (3). DEA&DP is currently revising its guidance and has called for more research on public finance and administration of the system (5).
At the national level, a best practice guideline on wetland offsets has been published jointly by the South Afrivan National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) and the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) (6). Furthermore, the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) in conjunction with South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) is leading the development of a national biodiversity offset framework: A draft policy was produced in 2012 and revised in 2016 and is expected to be released for public consultation in 2016. (Darbi et al. 2016).

In 2014, the provincial offsetting guidelines were supplemented by the first national offset
guidelines, specifically for wetlands, produced by SANBI6
, which is intended to apply nationally,
rather than to a particular province. The wetland offsets guidelines are primarily aimed at the
water use authorisation process, either as part of an application for a Water Use Licence under
the National Water Act or as part of an EIA under the NEMA.
The goal of wetland offsetting is to ?achieve no net loss and preferably a net gain on the ground
with respect to water resources (focusing on the importance of wetlands for supporting water
resource management objectives, as well as people?s use and cultural values associated with
wetlands), ecosystem and habitat objectives (especially in terms of meeting national and local
objectives for habitat protection and avoiding worsening of ecosystem threat status), and species
of special concern (particular threatened, rare or keystone wetland species)?. This reflects the
fact that wetlands are among the small number of ecosystems in South Africa for which
restoration ? under specific conditions - is considered a feasible option and hence appropriately
designed and implemented offsets might be able to achieve NNL or net gain through restoration
interventions. The guidelines provide details of how to achieve NNL with regard to impacts on
aquatic systems and include how to calculate the residual impact of a development on water
resources, ecosystems and species and specify the methodology to be applied when
determining the type and scale of offset required. Like the provincial plans, they are triggered by
the identification of ?medium? to ?high? significance impacts on wetland ecosystems.
The guidelines allow for five types of offset activity, which can be implemented in combination:
legal protection of previously unprotected areas, activities that avert losses to an existing
wetland, rehabilitation, establishment of a new wetland or direct compensation to affected
parties. However, determination of the size of an appropriate offset is markedly more complex for
wetlands than for terrestrial ecosystems, with calculations based on Hydro-Geomorphic Units
and a range of multipliers based on the impacts on water resources and ecosystem services,
impacts on ecosystem conservation (including protection and threat status, regional context,
local site attributes such as connectivity) and impacts on specific species. (FFI 2016)

A national biodiversity offsets policy framework is being developed, to guide biodiversity offsets which are implemented regularly in South Africa as part of the environmental authorisation process. South Africa?s approach to biodiversity offsets is underpinned by ecosystem-level biodiversity targets and the identification of spatial biodiversity priorities through systematic biodiversity planning (FFI.

Biodiversity offsets policy framework:
A policy framework to guide the implementation of biodiversity offsets has been developed and is in
the process of being finalised. South Africa?s approach to biodiversity offsets involves trading loss of
biodiversity in one place for securing additional equivalent biodiversity in another place, along with
financial provision for the appropriate management of the area secured. This approach is
underpinned by biodiversity targets (see Question 5), and the identification of spatial biodiversity
priorities through systematic biodiversity planning. Biodiversity offsets are actioned only after all
options to avoid, minimise and rehabilitate impacts of development activities have been exhausted,
and a significant residual negative impact still remains. Biodiversity offsets are implemented
regularly in South Africa as part of the environmental authorisation process, and although some
provinces have policies or guidelines relating to biodiversity offsets, to date there has not been a
national policy on biodiversity offsets. South Africa is contributing actively to global debates on the
philosophy and implementation of biodiversity offsets.
Biodiversity offsets have seen increasing use in EIAs, as well as other natural resource use permitting
processes, such as water use license applications and permits to clear natural forests. Biodiversity
offsets have been required for a wide range of development activities, as offsets are related to the
significance of the impact, and not specific to types of development, but the predominant types of
development that have triggered biodiversity offsets are mining, infrastructure (specifically dams,
power lines and major roads), urban expansion and resort development. A few biodiversity offsets
have also been required for agricultural expansion. The total number of biodiversity offsets
implemented in South Africa is estimated at <50 to date. There is not yet a national register of
biodiversity offsets, and administration of biodiversity offsets is generally still weak. (5th CBD report 2014)",

In 2006 an academic discussion started in South Korea, aiming to establish a Wet- land Mitigation Banking approach with a ?no net loss principle?. This has not yet been implemented. More recently, South Korean politicians have attempted to initiate compensation measures. In parallel, there has been research on defining which of several international compensation approaches would be the ?best fit? in the South Korean context. One recommendation was to adapt the German Ein- griffsregelung. In 2008, following the election of a new president, the research seems to have been stopped due to the rise of other political priorities (Darbi 2009). ",

Compensation for damage occurring in Natura 2000 sites is a legal requirement of the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.

Although some working group participants suggest the NNL Initiative should be
restricted to the terrestrial and freshwater environment, others considered it
should also extend to coastal and marine environments. The Strategy and Staff
Working Paper are silent on this issue. Coastal habitats, like many freshwater or
high altitude habitats, are very dynamic and subject to rapid and large-scale
shifts in their physical characteristics (e.g. through coastal erosion, flooding,
rock-fall) with important consequences for biodiversity. This creates specific
challenges to assessing impacts and designing appropriate offsets. The marine
environment presents some additional challenges in applying the mitigation
hierarchy and compensating for residual impacts although there is growing
experience in this in Europe and worldwide, not least from impact assessments
done for marine Natura 2000 sites. 32 It remains debatable whether knowledge is
sufficient to apply compensation in the marine environment in a comprehensive
and systematic way but there is nonetheless considerable potential for offsetting
some types of impacts (e.g. of coastal defences, ports and navigation, energy
infrastructure) in the marine environment, while ensuring additional gains with
regard to existing legal obligations under the MSFD and the nature directives.
Whilst re-creation per se of sea-bed habitats is very difficult, restoration or ?functional re-creation? measures and averted risk offsets33 both offer opportunities in the marine environment.

Inset 4: Case 3. Spain - La Bre¤a II reservoir project
The construction of the dam requires the destruction of 626 ha of a Natura 2000 site which notably provides habitat to the Lynx Pardelle (Iberian lynx); this is 1.05% of the total area of the site. The planned offsets include:
? the expropriation of 2,134 ha of land where the activities of improving the quality of the habitat and increasing the Lynx's prey species are planned;
? the restoration of habitats (afforestation, coppicing, etc.);
? the construction of refuges for the Lynx.
As there are no possible alternatives to the project, which is deemed to be of major public interest (response to the water consumption required by the population and industrial and agricultural sectors), the European Commission felt that the planned offsets were satisfactory and issued a favourable opinion (Source: opinion of the European comission 2004). (Morandeau and Villaysack 2012).",

and the designation of new protected habitats on other sites are the most common. The creation of habitats is used to a lesser

 In Spain, for example, a recent change in
national law is likely to be supportive of the emergence of local and regional offsetting, and
market development potential is thought to be in the region of ?150 million per year, despite
the currently limited growth in the domestic construction market. The next step will be
translation of the national requirements into appropriate guidelines at the level of the regions
? some specialist organisations such as Ecoacsa Reserva de Biodiversidad15 (see below)
are working with public and private institutions in Spain to accelerate this process  (Ec.europa).

The term ?compensation? does appear in regulations derived from EU Directives on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), nature conservation and other similar fields. EIA regulation establishes that
the Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) must include the prevention,mitigationand/or compensationmeasures tobe carried out when a project is finally implemented (Ministerio de Obras P£blicas y Urbanismo, 1988; Ministerio de Medio Ambiente, 2008). But not even a definition for ?compensation? is provided in any of these laws. The autonomousregulation,ontheotherhand,has to comply with the national one. But in some of the regions, stricter regulations can be found. They are in force only in the autonomous region that promulgates each regulation. Some of the 17 so-called ?autonomous regions? in Spain have passed regulatory provisions to foster the practice of compensation. Law 7/2007 in the autonomousregionofAndaluc¡a (ComunidadAut¢nomade Andaluc¡a, 2007), i.e., empowers the competent authority to enforce compensation when the damage caused to the natural values cannot be reversed in the affected place. It also allows the developer to pay a fine,
whichwill be used for carrying out compensatingmeasures. In the region of Arag¢n, Order of 4th April 2006 establishes theobligationtoimplement measures to compensate for environmental damage in potential wind farm areas that are ecologically sensitive. Law 11/2006 in the Balearic Islands (Comunidad Aut¢noma de las Illes Balears, 2006) forces developers to carry out ecological compensation, both in protected and in non-protected areas. Autonomous law in the region of Extremadura establishes the duty to compensate for measures taken to prevent bird nesting on power line infrastructures (Consejer¡a de Econom¡a y Trabajo de Extremadura, 2004). In the autonomous region of Navarra a reduction in forested land must be compensated by a reforestation area equivalent to the one lost (Comunidad Foral de Navarra, 1990). Other autonomous laws indicate the contents on compensation measures thatmustbe specified in theEIS, suchasmaps (Departamento
de Ordenaci¢n del Territorio y MedioAmbiente del Pa¡s Vasco, 2003), or the budget and implementation schedule tobe followed (PresidŠnciade la Generalitat de Catalunya, 1988; Comunidad Aut¢noma de Madrid, 2002). The design of compensation measures in the Environmental
Statement in the region of Arag¢n (Comunidad Aut¢noma de Arag¢n, 2006) must include the indicators tomonitor their implementation and effectiveness. Decree 93/2006 inNavarra (Comunidad Foral de Navarra, 2006) enforces the Environmental Statement to specify the exact amount of the deposit to be paid by the developer to provide for the implementation of the compensatorymeasures to be carried out in the project (Villaroya and Puig 2010).",

early indications that offset programs or policies may be developing in Indonesia, Malaysia,
Vietnam, Mongolia, and possibly Taiwan and South Korea  (Madsen et al 2010).

Taiwan?s establishment of the Wetland Act arose from protesting of a development project of
the Kuo-Kuang petrochemical plant project in 2005. The site of the development project was located on the delta of the Zuo-Shui River in central Taiwan. The delta is an intertidal zone with abundant marine species and is the habitat of the endangered migratory bird, the Eastern Curlew (Numenius
madagascariensis). [5] Both citizens and environmental groups challenged the necessity of building
petrochemical factories in this important wetland (Su 2014).

In 2004, the Taiwanese government decided to construct a reservoir to supply the growing water demand for agriculture and human consumption in western-central Taiwan; but, the area selected was also a breeding ground for the Fairy Pitta, a bird listed as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List. Unfortunately, the reservoir was unstoppable, so to compensate for the construction we assessed the potential habitat loss within the construction site and the habitat quality of the nearby area, with the aim to prioritise zones for reservation or restoration. Reservations protect those sites with good quality, whereas restoration should restore sites that have been damaged but have good connectivity to the sites with good quality (natually speaking blog).

If the utilization of the continuing conditions causes significant impact on the Wetland of Importance, the government authorities shall order the developer, managing entity, or user to improve their utilization measures by a prescribed date. If necessary, the government authorities may provide consultation to improve the utilization measures to a standard of ?wise use.? The term ?wise use? is defined in Article 4. If the utilization is overdue or the improvement failed to fit wise use and caused net loss in a Wetland of Importance, the violators will be penalized and the government will implement impact mitigation, offset compensation, and ecological compensation as described in Article 27 (Su 2014).",https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9933/d0b06397699eacec726289500bceec29a7b4.pdf

Compensatory measures 
66. Where in accordance with regulation 62 (considerations of overriding public interest)? (a) a plan or project is agreed to, notwithstanding a negative assessment of the implications for a European site or a European offshore marine site, or (b) a decision, or a consent, permission or other authorisation, is affirmed on review, notwithstanding such an assessment, the appropriate authority must secure that any necessary compensatory measures are taken to ensure that the overall coherence of Natura 2000 is protected. 

Compensatory measures 105. Where in accordance with regulation 103 (considerations of overriding public interest) a land use plan is given effect notwithstanding a negative assessment of the implications for a European site or a European offshore marine site, the appropriate authority must secure that any necessary compensatory measures are taken to ensure that the overall coherence of Natura 2000 is protected. 

","We will move progressively from net biodiversity loss to net gain, by supporting healthy, well-functioning ecosystems and establishing more coherent ecological networks. Our 2020 mission is to halt overall biodiversity loss, support healthy well-functioning ecosystems and establish coherent ecological networks, with more and better places for nature for the benefit of wildlife and people.
- We will work to achieve more, bigger, better and less- fragmented areas for wildlife, including no net loss of priority habitat and an increase of at least 200,000 hectares in the overall extent of priority habitats.
- The National Ecosystems Assessment40 identifies land- use change as one of the major impacts on biodiversity in the UK. We want the planning system to contribute 40. Source: HM Government, 2011.

The interaction of these pollutants with marine ecosystems is complex and the effects of such cumulative impacts on receptors is not fully understood? A considerable proportion of marine pollution originates from non-point sources such as windblown debris and run-off from terrestrial environments? It should be noted that such a development could also have wide ranging secondary impacts resulting from the disruption of coastal processes, changes in water currents and sediment transport pathways as well as disruption of commercial fishing activities, all of which could have a secondary impact on marine biodiversity. There can also be significant cumulative impacts where several

marine habitat banking and offsetting?. The UK has lagged behind global best practice on biodiversity offsets. In the UK, mandatory offsetting is currently only required where development of overriding public interest has significant impacts on the Natura 2000 network. However, the gap has narrowed in recent years with growing interest in the wider use of offsets in England and Europe.
Guidance for terrestrial planning in England is currently provided in national planning policy
statements (PPSs). PPS9 on biodiversity and geological conservation allows for the possibility
of biodiversity offsetting (Treweek et al., 2009) but examples remain relatively few and the
extent to which local planning authorities have required developers to demonstrate
appropriate application of the mitigation hierarchy has been variable. The Lawton Review
(Lawton et.al. 2010) investigated, inter alia, further use of a formal system of biodiversity
offsets, and they have been referred to in the Government?s White Paper on the Environment
and ?Biodiversity 2020?. A voluntary pilot scheme to trial the use of biodiversity offsets in
England is currently under development3. The metrics and guidance on its operation have
recently been developed (Defra, 2011) (Dickie et al. 2013).",
United Kingdom,European Union,Europe,Yes,No,Yes,Implicit,Compensation,Biodiversity,Natura 2000 (Marine),Legislation,2010,"*EU: In the Member States of the European Union, several Directives relevant to compensation are applicable, including the Birds and Habitats Directives, the European Liability Directive, and the EIA and SEA Directives.","EU legislation protects a wide variety of habitats and species. Compensation for damage occurring in Natura 2000 sites is a legal requirement of the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.

Although some working group participants suggest the NNL Initiative should be restricted to the terrestrial and freshwater environment, others considered it should also extend to coastal and marine environments. The Strategy and Staff Working Paper are silent on this issue. Coastal habitats, like many freshwater or high altitude habitats, are very dynamic and subject to rapid and large-scale shifts in their physical characteristics (e.g. through coastal erosion, flooding,
rock-fall) with important consequences for biodiversity. This creates specific
challenges to assessing impacts and designing appropriate offsets. The marine environment presents some additional challenges in applying the mitigation hierarchy and compensating for residual impacts although there is growing experience in this in Europe and worldwide, not least from impact assessments done for marine Natura 2000 sites. 32 It remains debatable whether knowledge is sufficient to apply compensation in the marine environment in a comprehensive and systematic way but there is nonetheless considerable potential for offsetting some types of impacts (e.g. of coastal defences, ports and navigation, energy infrastructure) in the marine environment, while ensuring additional gains with regard to existing legal obligations under the MSFD and the nature directives.
Whilst re-creation per se of sea-bed habitats is very difficult, restoration or ?functional re-creation? measures and averted risk offsets33 both offer opportunities in the marine environment. Similarly, although offsetting at the coast requires the resolution of different issues - not least reversibility questions associated with coastal erosion or with saline inundation34 - experience in coastal habitat restoration, creation and enhancement also continues to evolve. Further there may be opportunities to compensate for some marine activities by offsetting in the coastal environment.","Under the EU Habitats Directive, the UK is required to:
? Maintain or restore habitats and species listed in Annex I and II at a favourable
conservation status;
? Contribute to a coherent European ecological network of protected sites by
designating Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) for habitats listed on Annex I and
for species listed on Annex II. These measures are also to be applied to Special
Protection Areas (SPAs) classified under Article 4 of the Birds Directive. Together
SACs and SPAs make up the Natura 2000 network;
? Ensure conservation measures are in place to appropriately manage SACs and
ensure appropriate assessment of plans and projects likely to have a significant
effect on the integrity of a SAC. Projects may still be permitted if there are no
alternatives, and there are imperative reasons of overriding public interest. In such
cases compensatory measures are necessary to ensure the overall coherence of the
Natura 2000 network; and
? Ensure strict protection of species listed on Annex IV. (Dickie et al. 2013)",,In Progress,confirmed,NNL,"Tucker, Graham; Allen, Ben; Conway,

baseline? which includes the past and present impacts of all Federal, state, or private actions and other
human activities in the action area, the anticipated impacts of all proposed Federal projects in the action

To offset habitat loss and increase fishery production an eelgrass mitigation habitat was
completed in San Diego Bay, California in 1997. The newly created eelgrass habitat
quickly performed at the level of the existing eelgrass bed and was not significantly
different from the reference eelgrass habitat in terms of fishes (Pondella, et al, 2006) (Dickie et al. 2013).

After NEPA, the mitigation and compensation of wetlands according to the Clean Water Act (CWA) is the second most important approach to addressing impacts on biological diversity (4). In principle, according to section 404, activities in wetlands are forbidden, if the wetland would be significantly damaged or if a feasible, less environmentally harmful alternative exists. However, permission to damage wetland can be granted under exceptional circumstances by the US Army Corps of Engineers (the authority responsible for the execution of the law). In 1990 the Department of the Army and the
U.S. EPA entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) (6). This document clarifies the ?appropriate and practicable steps? required by the environmental guidelines from 1980 to offset unavoidable impacts to wetlands under the õ404 regulatory program (7). A three-part mitigation sequence consisting of appropriate and practicable avoidance, minimization, and compensation was established to achieve the goal of no overall net loss of wetland functions and values (8): First, the project proponent has to avoid alteration of wetlands by using the least environmentally damaging site. This may include sites that are not owned by the proponent. Second, a plan has to be developed
to minimize the adverse effects of the unavoidable impacts. Finally, if after the rectification and reduction over time, impacts still remain, the proponent has to adopt appropriate compensation measures. This may either be done by paying monetary compensation or using the services provided by a third party, usually a private investor with a commercial interest, a so-called mitigation bank. Since the middle of the 1990s mitigation banking has become a significant business in the United States (9), bringing in USD 2.0-3.4 billion and over 15,000 hectares (37,700 acres) annually (10). The Issuance of the Federal Banking Guidance in 1995 brought about a proliferation of the number of banks across the United States and commercial mitigation banks became a ?mainstream option? (7). US mitigation banking is still showing increases, with a total of 1,044 active and sold-out wetland, stream and conservation banks (10). (Darbi et al. 2016).",

This regulation sets the minimum content that should be in or a part of the EIS study, however there is no clear and specific mention of the Mitigation Hierarchy. Mitigation is meant to 'reduce' environmental impacts and that there shall be a calculation of residual environmental impacts ""in the case where the measures were adopted."" Apart from this, there is no further elaboration on the mitigation approach and no specific requirement to adhere to compensatory measures, as the regulation only stated compensatory or resotrative measures to be ""considered"".

(A) mitigation measures to be applied to reduce environmental impacts
identified;
B) contingency and risk prevention plans;
(C) the compensatory or restorative measures to be taken;
D) the environmental management plans of the project; Y
E) the abandonment programs that will need to be adopted. (GIBOP 2018)","The Law itself defines in its Article 2§ as negative or hurtful environmental impact, every modification of the physical, chemical or biological properties of the environment caused by any
form of material or energy resulting from the human activities which direct or indirectly hurt or damage the health, safety or quality of life of the population; the aesthetic, cultural or sanitary
conditions of the environment and the configuration, quality and diversity of natural resources (UNDP 2001).","EIA with mitigation measures necessary (Donswald et al. 2012)

nother example of mitigation measures can be the mining enterprises, which in Uruguay are generally small in area, and of non-metal minerals. If part of the project includes the destruction of wetlands and native forest; the MVOTMA may authorised partial exploitation, not allowing its realisation in the area of wetlands and native forest. For the abandonment phase of the
mining projects, restoration of the landscape and natural vegetation may be required. In the case of the construction of dams and ponds for irrigation the ?ecological river current ? is required, so that a minimum flow of water is maintained to ensure sustenance of biological corridors and the water supply to the ecosystems downstream of the dam. In summary, we can say that the different mitigation measures will depend on the kind of project, to be implemented under legal action according to the MVOTMA requirements (UNDP 2001).",,Potential,confirmed,,"Madsen et al. 2011; Donswald et al. 2012; Darbi et al. 2009; http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/marketwatch/biodiversity/latin-america/

- As Figure 1 shows, NNL/NG and more general compensation systems have evolved and grown in number since the 1970s. NNL and subsequently NG has been a feature of policy in the USA for over two decades, while biodiversity offsets and credit trading are comparatively new in Australia and Brazil. There are recent policy measures in Colombia and France, measures are under development in countries such as South Africa, Peru and England, and exploration of policy options is in its early stages in a suite of other countries (e.g. Canada, Uganda, Namibia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Mongolia) (Ten Kate and Crowe 2014).
In Asia, the past year has seen some countries, including Vietnam and Japan, make progress
on frameworks for biodiversity payment mechanisms. In Japan, a number of initiatives
were launched to explore the feasibility of biodiversity offsets in the country, while Vietnam?s new decree outlining a compensation process for environmental damages took effect in early 2011 (Madsen et al. 2011).

Vietnam passed a biodiversity law that went into effect July 1, 2009 that covers Compensation
for Damage to Biodiversity (article 75) and stipulates that damage payments or
compensation will be required and ?reinvested in biodiversity conservation and sustainable
development.?13 Details of the implementation of Vietnam?s Biodiversity Law will be spelled
out in a forthcoming decree ? expected sometime in 2010 (Madsen et al. 2010).


In Asia, the efforts by Vietnam, Japan, and Mongolia are well advanced (Pilla 2014).

Vietnam?s Biodiversity Law

In Vietnam, a legal framework on biodiversity offsets already exists. Article 75 of the recent Biodiversity Law states that ?organizations or individuals that infringe upon conservation areas or biodiversity conservation facilities? shall pay damages in accordance with law?, and that ?damage caused to biodiversity due to environmental pollution or degradation shall be compensated in accordance with law?.  In addition, MONRE has just submitted for approval to the Prime Minister a draft national decree on compensation for environmental damages. These pieces of legislation will serve as a foundational framework upon which biodiversity offset policy can be developed in Vietnam.

During the workshop held with MARD and MONRE on April 22, participants agreed that the Business and Biodiversity Offsets Program approach can be adopted in Vietnam.

The Next Steps

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, in the name of the Directorate of Forestry has stated that biodiversity offsets are potentially very useful for Vietnam and requested the technical support of BBOP, which gratefully accepted this opportunity to assist Vietnam balance its development and conservation objectives.  Conclusions from the workshop included the following points:

The Government of Vietnam is interested to learn more from international experiences and the existing knowledge developed by projects within Vietnam to establish suitable policies and support programs that work for government, companies and civil society.
BBOP will assist MARD develop one or more pilot projects in special use forest areas.
BBOP will run a regional or sub-regional training on biodiversity offsets, in order to build Vietnamese capacity in this field of expertise.
BBOP will provide policy and research support to help improve and develop existing Vietnamese policies and supporting legislative arrangements, such as incorporating biodiversity offsets into the Environmental Impact Assessment framework, the Strategic Environmental Assessment, the Biodiversity Law, and/or the Compensation for Environmental Damages framework.
Over the next several months, MARD and BBOP expect to develop a Memorandum of Understanding that will capture shared expectations, roles and responsibilities for this work.  They will develop a workplan for the following two year period that will define activities and objectives, as well as the resources needed to achieve them (Katoombagroup).
